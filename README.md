## The output

If everything is working you should have a ready-to-be-used JSON dataset.
A line from the dataset should look like something like this:
```
{"text": "i am looking for a fast food restaurant", "intent": "get_restaurants", "entities": [{"start": 19, "end": 39, "value": "fast food restaurant", "entity": "food"}]},
```
Here is a description of the different elements:
* "text": contains the full query generated by the program
* "intent": indicate the kind of action/category linked to the query
* "entities": indicate the location and value of the keyword in the sentence, in the example it's "fast food restaurant"
* "entity": additional information aimed to facilitate the classification of the query
